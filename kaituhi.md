We collect personal information directly from you.

We will use your personal information:

- to provide certain features and services of the App including but not limited to the ability to log in and use the app across multiple devices;
- to respond to communications from you, including a complaint;
- to protect and/or enforce our legal rights and interests, including defending any claim;
- for any other purpose authorised by you or the Act.

## Disclosing your personal information

We may disclose your personal information to:

- a person who can require us to supply your personal information (e.g. a regulatory authority);
- any other person authorised by the Act or another law (e.g. a law enforcement agency);
- any other person authorised by you.

A business that supports our services and products may be located outside New Zealand. This may mean your personal information is held and processed outside New Zealand.

## Accessing and correcting your personal information

Subject to certain grounds for refusal set out in the Act, you have the right to access your readily retrievable personal information that we hold and to request a correction to your personal information. Before you exercise this right, we will need evidence to confirm that you are the individual to whom the personal information relates.

In respect of a request for correction, if we think the correction is reasonable and we are reasonably able to change the personal information, we will make the correction. If we do not make the correction, we will take reasonable steps to note on the personal information that you requested the correction.

If you want to exercise either of the above rights, email us at privacy@tehiku.nz. Your email should provide evidence of who you are and set out the details of your request (e.g. the personal information, or the correction, that you are requesting).

Your personal information is deleted when you terminate your service and delete your Kaituhi account.

## Internet use

While we take reasonable steps to maintain secure internet connections, if you provide us with personal information over the internet, the provision of that information is at your own risk.
