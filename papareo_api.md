## Introduction
Te Reo Irirangi o Te Hiku o Te Ika (we, us, our) complies with the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020 (the Act) when dealing with personal information. Personal information is information about an identifiable individual (a natural person).

This policy sets out how we will collect, use, disclose and protect your personal information.

This policy does not limit or exclude any of your rights under the Act. If you wish to seek further information on the Act, see www.privacy.org.nz.

## Changes to this policy
We may change this policy by uploading a revised policy onto the website. The change will apply from the date that we upload the revised policy.

## Who do we collect your personal information from 
We will only collect personal information about you from you, when you provide that personal information to us, 
through any contact with us (e.g. telephone call or email) or when creating an account to use the API.

## How we use your personal information
We will use your personal information:
  - associate with your account and usage of our services,
  - to respond to communications from you, including a complaint
  - to protect and/or enforce our legal rights and interests, including defending any claim
  - for any other purpose authorised by you or the Act.

## Disclosing your personal information
We may disclose your personal information to:
  - a person who can require us to supply your personal information (e.g. a regulatory authority)
  - any other person authorised by the Act or another law (e.g. a law enforcement agency)
  - any other person authorised by you.

A business that supports our services and products may be located outside New Zealand. This may mean your personal information is held and processed outside New Zealand.

## Protecting your personal information
We will take reasonable steps to keep your personal information safe from loss, unauthorised activity, or other misuse.

## Accessing and correcting your personal information
Subject to certain grounds for refusal set out in the Act, you have the right to access your readily retrievable personal information that we hold and to request a correction to your personal information. Before you exercise this right, we will need evidence to confirm that you are the individual to whom the personal information relates.

In respect of a request for correction, if we think the correction is reasonable and we are reasonably able to change the personal information, we will make the correction. If we do not make the correction, we will take reasonable steps to note on the personal information that you requested the correction.

If you want to exercise either of the above rights, email us at privacy@tehiku.nz. Your email should provide evidence of who you are and set out the details of your request (e.g. the personal information, or the correction, that you are requesting).

## Internet use
While we take reasonable steps to maintain secure internet connections, if you provide us with personal information over the internet, the provision of that information is at your own risk.

If you follow a link on our website to another site, the owner of that site will have its own privacy policy relating to your personal information. We suggest you review that site’s privacy policy before you provide personal information.

## Analytics
We collect statistics on what APIs are used. All statistics we collect are anonymous and no personal information is collected in the process,
except for metrics associated with how much of the API you use in order to provide the services.

We collect aggregated information on what content is viewed and played and how much of that content is played. We also record the time that the content was accessed. We do not record your IP address, location, or any other identifiable information.

This aggregate, anonymous information may be shared with third parties such as public broadcasting funding agencies for the purpose of securing continual funding for Māori content.
