# Rongo App Privacy

## Summary

### Personal Information

We collect some personal information on you in order to provide the services of the Rongo App.

We create a _unique code_ associated with your usage of the App. This enables the saving of your progress in the app should you need to transfer to another device.

If and only if you decide to share your recordings with us, then we will collect those recordings and metadata associated with those recordings. Your unique code will also be associated with these recordings and their metadata.

If and only if you decide to log in to the Rongo App, then we will collect your email. Your email is used to associate your personal information (email) with your unique code. This enables features such as using Rongo across multiple devices as well as any new features that require you to have an account with the App.

All data we collect falls under our [Kaitiakitanga License](/kaitiakitanga). We may use data you share with us to improve our services or to conduct Māori-led research on pronunciation. For example, recordings you share with us may be used to train new models for pronunciation, or we may use those recordings to identify common pronunciation mistakes made by learners of te reo Māori.

### Te Reo Māori and Mātauranga Māori

The data you may decide to share with us from Rongo will create unprecedented opportunities for future Māori-led research around te reo Māori and the evolution of the sounds of te reo Māori in a post-colonial age. We may, from time to time, work with third party researchers such as Māori scholars, Māori language communities, or Universities to conduct this research.

## Introduction

Te Reo Irirangi o Te Hiku o Te Ika (we, us, our) complies with the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020 (the Act) when dealing with personal information. Personal information is information about an identifiable individual (a natural person).

This policy sets out how we will collect, use, disclose and protect your personal information.

This policy does not limit or exclude any of your rights under the Act. If you wish to seek further information on the Act, see www.privacy.org.nz.

## Changes to this policy

We may change this policy by uploading a revised policy onto the website. The change will apply from the date that we upload the revised policy.

## Who do we collect your personal information from

We collect personal information directly from you.

A _unique code_ is generated to enable you to use the Rongo App. This cannot be disabled. The unique code does not personally identify you, but it does associate your progress in the app with a code unique to you and only you.

We will only collect your recordings and metadata associated with those recordings when you explicitly share that data with us. You can change your preference to share your data with us at anytime in the Settings of the App. Your unique code is associated with this data.

We will only collect your email when you decide to Log In to the Rongo App. Your unique code is associated with this email.

## How we use your personal information

We will use your personal information:

- to provide certain features and services of the App including but not limited to the ability to log in and use the app across multiple devices,
- to respond to communications from you, including a complaint
- to protect and/or enforce our legal rights and interests, including defending any claim
- for any other purpose authorised by you or the Act.

## Disclosing your personal information

We may disclose your personal information to:

- a person who can require us to supply your personal information (e.g. a regulatory authority)
- any other person authorised by the Act or another law (e.g. a law enforcement agency)
- any other person authorised by you.

A business that supports our services and products may be located outside New Zealand. This may mean your personal information is held and processed outside New Zealand.

## Protecting your personal information

We will take reasonable steps to keep your personal information safe from loss, unauthorised activity, or other misuse.

All network communication from Rongo to our servers is done using TLS.

Only authorised staff at Te Reo Irirangi o Te Hiku o Te Ika (Te Hiku Media) can access to your personal information.

## Accessing and correcting your personal information

Subject to certain grounds for refusal set out in the Act, you have the right to access your readily retrievable personal information that we hold and to request a correction to your personal information. Before you exercise this right, we will need evidence to confirm that you are the individual to whom the personal information relates.

In respect of a request for correction, if we think the correction is reasonable and we are reasonably able to change the personal information, we will make the correction. If we do not make the correction, we will take reasonable steps to note on the personal information that you requested the correction.

If you want to exercise either of the above rights, email us at privacy@tehiku.nz. Your email should provide evidence of who you are and set out the details of your request (e.g. the personal information, or the correction, that you are requesting).

### Deleting Your Data

You may delete all data associated with your usage of the Rongo App in the Settings of the App. This action cannot be undone. Your data will be scheduled for deletion and it may take up to 24 hours for your data to be deleted. If you would like to expedite the deletion process, or if you wish to cancel the deletion process, you should <a href="mailto:awhina@rongo.app?subject=Deleting my data">contact us promptly.</a>

Unless you request your data to be deleted, we will look after it indefinitely under our [Kaitiakitanga License](/kaitiakitanga).

## Internet use

While we take reasonable steps to maintain secure internet connections, if you provide us with personal information over the internet, the provision of that information is at your own risk.
